# Identify_Customer_Segments

## Introduction
In this project, I have performed customer segmentation task over the dataset provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. They have provided their private dataset to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. This task was assigned in udacity's nanodegree program.
